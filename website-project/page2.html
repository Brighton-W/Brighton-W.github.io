    <h2>Gyms</h2>
    <p>Gyms are typically a place where trainers go to train their Pokemon, similar to a real gym where you would go to work out and build strength. A trainer can go to a gym to sharpentheri battling skills and where Pokemon can gain experience.</p>
    <p>Most gyms specialize in a certain particular type of Pokemon, such as electric, fire, water or psychic. the most powerful trainer in any given gym is called the gym leader.</p>
    <p>Most gyms are designed to follow and suit the type the gym specializes in. However, there are some gyms that do not practice this.</p>
    <p>Official gyms are certified by a Pokemon league and atleast eight gym badges are required before entering a League Competition.</p>
